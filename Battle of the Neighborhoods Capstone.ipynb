If a restaurant owner were to open a restaurant that is in a low-population area, the brand may not become widly recognized or attended by locals or attract people from other areas, affecting the revenue. If a restaurant is open in an area with low-income the restaurant will again not likely have many customers or frequency of repeat visits even if the population is there as the customer base may not be able to afford dinning out. Combining low-income and low-population would be an aggrivated scenario affecting the ability for the restaurant to continue operations. Moreover, even in well populated and good income neighbourhoods, if there are a lot of well-known restaurant options already existing, customer loyalty might be strong and the new openning ignored. All of these factors are important to consider in a new venture as they directly impact profitability and the possible longevity of the restaurants existence. Therefore, for potential restaurant owners, the problem of location is worth paying attention to and doing some analysis before even starting the search for a venue. "
